### `ngRouter` aka `angular-route`
The simplest library for routing URLs to Controller code and loading templates is `ngRouter`, which comes as the `angular-route` package from Bower. Take some time to review the API for `$routeProvider` and the examples in the official documentation.

* How do I define...
  - ...a route for my application with ngRouter?

  - ...dynamic pieces (params) to routes?

  - ...the template to load for a route?

  - ...the controller to trigger for a route?

* How do I retrieve...
  - ...the params from a route in a controller?
  
  - ...the controller for a route in the view?
