file w/o js:
* can not choose between grid or list view
* bulleted list
* no item images
* no add to cart button


file w/ js:
* content is interactive and you can toggle over gird or list buttons to change the view
* add-to-cart buttons for each item
* images for each item


How to fix:
* write function that lets you `switch` view modes from grid to list
*

switch (expression) { //whoa Atom tryed to help me when i typed `switch`... might be helpful????
  case expression:

    break;
  default:

} grid and list buttons
*
*
